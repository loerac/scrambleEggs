# scrambleEggs
Finds all the permutations of a phrase

# Getting Started
Use the GNU g++ compiler for main.cpp

g++ main.cpp -o scrambleEggs

# Example
Run the script by giving it the phrase and/or an amount of permutations you would like

./scrambleEggs [phrase] [n permutations (optional)]

Not giving the amount of permutations you want will automatically do all the permutations of the phrase
